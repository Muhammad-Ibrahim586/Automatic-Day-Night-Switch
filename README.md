# Automatic Day-Night Switch

## Overview
The Automatic Day-Night Switch is a project designed to demonstrate the automation of switching electrical devices based on light intensity. This project uses sensors to detect ambient light levels and toggles the circuit accordingly. It is an efficient solution for energy saving in homes and businesses.

## Features
1) Automatically switches devices on and off based on ambient light.
2) Designed for energy efficiency and convenience.
3) Simulated using Proteus for accurate performance testing.

## Components Used
1) **Light Dependent Resistor (LDR):** Senses the ambient light levels.
2) **Relay Module:** Controls the switching mechanism.
3) **Transistors and Resistors:** For circuit operation.
4) **Proteus Simulation Software:** Used for designing and testing the circuit.

## How It Works
The circuit uses an LDR to sense light intensity. When the light level falls below a certain threshold (indicating night), the relay activates to turn on connected devices. Similarly, when the light intensity exceeds the threshold (indicating day), the relay turns off the devices.

## Files Included
1) **Proteus Simulation File:** The `.pdsprj` file containing the circuit design.
2) **Report.pdf:** A detailed explanation of the project, including the design, working principles, and applications.

## Instructions
1. Download the repository.
2. Open the Proteus file in Proteus Design Suite.
3. Run the simulation to see the circuit in action.
4. Refer to the report for a comprehensive understanding of the project.

## Applications
1) Street lighting systems.
2) Automatic lighting control in homes and offices.
3) Energy conservation in industrial settings.
